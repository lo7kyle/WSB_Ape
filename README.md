Stock Analysis and Trade using Reddit API to use NLP on WSB subreddit to predict short squeeze

### My Thought Process:  
- Extract the top/hot posts from the subreddit. 
  - This will allow me to see which posts are being talked about most and not just a bot or spam click bait
- Rate the title using sentiment to organize negative outlook vs positive outlook.  
  - Being Negative or Positive are both good. This will allow me to asses the prediction of certain stocks talked about
- Account for Occurances and less sentiment. 
  - As a fellow ape I understand our language can be more negative than positive, but have a counter for ticker symbols to follow hype
  - Look at other subreddits for comparison for these ticker symbols because WSB can be a little primitive in terms of analysis
- Look at the fundamentals of the stock along with research (volume, trendlines, innovations, leadership, etc...)
